# Solving Laplace on a Mobius Strip

Our goal is to explore finite difference methods or finite element methods for Laplace's equation in polar coordinated, which we will validate by comparison to a toy proble. We aim to solve the problem on an annulus and then, hopefully, on a Mobius strip*

*We want to speak with Brennan about solving this on a Mobius strip. If this task proves to be too difficult or something, we will instead modify our solver to work with immersed boundary methods in polar coordinates.
